# CT-e Web Automation
Software developed in Python with the purpose of inserting "CT-e" in the system of "Grupo Saga" automatically. "CT-e" is the abbreviation for an electronic document whose goal is to document informations about transportation of goods and "Grupo Saga" is the company where I work currently. In order to do the tasks in a more efficient way, I decided to create a software in Python using Selenium as the main library to automate the task of inserting these documents. Previously, it was necessary to type many informations in the system of the company and to insert these documents one by one, but now it's possible to prepare the documents by downloading the ".pdf" and the ".xml" and just pass simple informations about the bill like the due date.

# Web Automation - CT-e
Software developed in Python with the purpose of inserting "CT-e" on the "Grupo Saga" website automatically. "CT-e" is the abbreviation for an electronic document whose goal is to document informations about transportation of goods and "Grupo Saga" is the company that'll be benefited with this project. 

In order to do the tasks more efficiently, I decided to create a software in Python using Selenium as the main library to automate the task of inserting these documents on the website. Previously, it was necessary to type manually many informations on the company website and to insert these documents individually, but now it's possible to prepare the documents by downloading the ".pdf" and the ".xml" files and by passing informations about the bill like the due date. It's even more useful for bills that contains the values of hundreds of "CT-e" documents, since they can be inserted with this software with just a few clicks.

# Instructions
1 - On the first screen, it's necessary to fill in the fields with the login and the corresponding password that'll grant access to the website.

These images are screenshots of the software running, but no further screenshots are possible since it's a private company and data can't be exposed.
